  This is a fallback sitemap. The application now serves dynamic sitemaps at /sitemap.xml
  which automatically includes all products from the Firebase database. This file serves as
  a fallback if the dynamic route fails.
  
  Dynamic sitemap is generated by:
  - Admin panel at /admin000/products (Regenerate Sitemap button)
  - Automatic regeneration when products are added/updated/deleted
  - Served dynamically from app/sitemap.xml/route.ts
