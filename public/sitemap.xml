  This is a placeholder sitemap. The application Admin panel regenerates a fresh
  sitemap (including products) and stores it under Realtime Database node: sitemap/latestXml.
  To expose the dynamic sitemap to crawlers at /sitemap.xml you can:
   1. During deployment, fetch the value from the database and overwrite this file, OR
   2. Add a lightweight backend / Cloud Function to serve the latest XML from the database path.
