  BACKUP/REFERENCE FILE - This is NOT the active sitemap.
  
  The application now serves dynamic sitemaps at /sitemap.xml (http://localhost:3000/sitemap.xml)
  which automatically includes all products from the Firebase database.
  
  This file was renamed from sitemap.xml to sitemap-static.xml to avoid conflicts 
  with the Next.js API route at app/sitemap.xml/route.ts.
  
  Active dynamic sitemap features:
  - Automatically includes all products with URLs: /{category}/{slug}
  - Updates in real-time when products are added/updated/deleted
  - Managed through admin panel at /admin000/products
  - Served from Firebase Realtime Database via REST API
